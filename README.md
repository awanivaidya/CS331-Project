# AI-Based Customer Communication Analysis and Risk Alert System  

---

## Overview  
The **AI-Based Customer Communication Analysis and Risk Alert System** is a customer support automation platform designed to analyze customer communications such as emails and meeting transcripts in order to monitor customer sentiment, satisfaction trends, and potential SLA-related risks.

The system applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically classify sentiment, generate concise summaries of communications, and track sentiment changes over time. Based on predefined rules and thresholds, the system identifies high-risk customers and generates alerts to support proactive

## Objectives  
- Automate the analysis of customer emails and meeting transcripts  
- Identify customer sentiment using AI-based NLP techniques  
- Generate short, meaningful summaries of communications  
- Track customer sentiment trends over time  
- Detect potential SLA and customer relationship risks  
- Provide alerts for early risk identification  

---

## Business Use Case  
Organizations receive a large volume of customer communications daily, making manual analysis time-consuming and inefficient. This system reduces the manual effort required to review emails and meeting notes, enables early detection of dissatisfied or high-risk customers, and supports timely mitigation actions. By automating sentiment analysis and risk detection, organizations can improve SLA compliance, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

## Key Features  
- Customer profile creation with defined requirements and SLAs  
- Upload and analysis of customer emails and meeting transcripts  
- AI-based sentiment classification (positive, neutral, negative)  
- Automatic generation of short summaries for each communication  
- Aggregation of sentiment scores at the customer level  
- Visual representation of sentiment trends  
- Rule-based detection of SLA and relationship risks  
- Alert generation for high-risk customers  

---

## System Architecture  
The system follows a modular architecture consisting of:  
- Web-based user interface for data input and visualization  
- Backend services for customer management and automation logic  
- NLP engine for sentiment analysis and summarization  
- Database for persistent storage of customer data and analysis results  
- Alert module for risk notification

## Technology Stack  
- Backend: Python, Flask  
- NLP: Pre-trained or fine-tuned BERT model  
- Summarization: Extractive NLP techniques  
- Database: SQLite  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Authentication: Microsoft Azure

## Functional Scope  
- Create and manage customer profiles  
- Define customer requirements and SLA parameters  
- Upload and process customer communications  
- Analyze sentiment and generate summaries  
- Maintain sentiment history and trends  
- Identify high-risk customers based on predefined rules  
- Display alerts and visual indicators for quick decision-making  

---

## Non-Functional Considerations  
- Fast processing of uploaded communications  
- User-friendly and intuitive interface  
- Secure storage of customer data  
- Modular and maintainable system design
